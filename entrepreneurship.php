											<p style="font-size:16px"><font color="#303030">I was the first to get a PhD in astrophysics from a Lebanese university. I want to make sure that I'm not the last.
												So in 2018 I founded <a href="http://shespeaksscience.com/" target="_blank">She Speaks Science</a>, to challenge the narrative of who does STEM and highlight women scientists.
											Today, She Speaks Science has grown into a global enterprise. Our storytellers write about their STEM research in the monthly publication, Scheherazade, offered in five languages and we
										 run fun and engaging storytelling workshops at schools.<br><br>
											I'm committed to the advancement of not only women in STEM but also women in business.<br><br>
											At Cambridge Judge Business School Entrepreneurship Centre I designed, launched and led EnterpriseWOMEN, a programme informed by research
												and human experience to help enterprising women grow their businesses. Within a few months of its launch, it grew into a
												 movement championed by seasoned and aspiring entrepreneurs, VIP supporters and contributors of the highest calibre.</font></p>
